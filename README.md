# ServigariAPI_Python
API that handles backend tasks in Servigari.

### What is Servigari?
Servigari is my dad's business which is engaged to repair home appliances. 
I took advantage of his need of managing the daily incomes and expenses to start this project.

Actually, I've developed a .NET Windows Application version. However, I decided to make its web version and, instead of re-using the .NET backend program, I'm taking advantage of the situation to learn new Python skills and ReactJS (in front-end). 

### Main goal of the project
This set of Python files were developed as an Introduction project in pursuit of my personal improvement.
The project is a small backend program were SQL queries are executed to retrieve and manage data (CRUD).

At a business level, it manages income and expenses from a home appliance repair familiar commerce.

At an architecture level, this project works as an API to handle all the transactions requested by the final user. 
The UI will be developed in using ReactJS and will consume this Python API. 

It's important to note that Python may not be the best option but, again, is only for personal improvements.

**First steps**

Execute Database/RegistersDB_Creation.py to initialize DB with the corresponds tables.
Then, in case you need or want to explore and test, run Database/SampleData.py which fills the tables with some generic data.
